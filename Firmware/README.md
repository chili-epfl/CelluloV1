Cellulo robot firmware
======================

This repository contains the Cellulo robot firmware and tools. A new Cellulo robot must first have its Bluetooth module configured. Then, the firmware must be built and flashed to the microcontroller.

Building and flashing the PIC32MZ firmware
==========================================
What you need (available at [http://icchilisrv1.epfl.ch](http://icchilisrv1.epfl.ch)):

  - MPLAB X 2.35

    - If you have a 64 bit machine, 32 bit libraries are needed to install MPLAB X to run. Run the following 		to install the libraries    (https://microchipdeveloper.com/install:mplabx-lin64)
      
        sudo apt-get install libc6:i386 libx11-6:i386 libxext6:i386 libstdc++6:i386 libexpat1:i386

    - Then, to install MPLAB X, go to .sh file location and run;
    
        chmod +x MPLABX-v2.35-linux-installer.sh
        
        sudo bash MPLABX-v2.35-linux-installer.sh

  - xc 1.34
	- To install with .run file located at http://icchilisrv1.epfl.ch/files/cellulo/firmware-tools/linux/;
	fileâ†’ properties> permissions> tick the make file executable box

  - Harmony 1.03 (to install, go to Tools -> Plugins -> Downloaded -> Add Plugins and select `harmony-install-path/v1_03/utilities/mhc/com-microchip-mplab-modules-mhc.nbm`, then press Install)

Load the project into MPLAB X, connect the robot over ICSP and click the *Make and Program Device* button.

Note that the directory paths and file names are documented strictly in the configurations.xml file, which can be found inside the project folder (cellulo-firmware.X/nbproject). Place all the files and folders accordingly to prevent #include issues when loading the project into MPLAB.

 Configuring the RN42 Bluetooth module
=====================================

Upon powering up the robot, within 60 seconds, run the `rn42-autoconf.py` script under `scripts/` (`pybluez` should be installed). To do it manually, connect to it with a serial console over Bluetooth. Within 60 seconds of powerup, type

```
$$$
```

to enter command mode. The module should respond with `CMD<cr><lf>`. Then, type

```
SU,921K<cr>
```

The module should respond with `AOK<cr><lf>`. Then, type

```
ST,255<cr>
```

The module should respond with `AOK<cr><lf>`. Then, type

```
SW,0140<cr>
```

The module should respond with `AOK<cr><lf>`. Then, type

```
SJ,0600<cr>

```
The module should respond with `AOK<cr><lf>`. Then, type

```
SA,2<cr>
```

The module should respond with `AOK<cr><lf>`. Finally, reboot the module with

```
R,1<cr>
```

Now build and flash the firmware to the microcontroller.

 
***

If it is your first time working with Cellulo, you might need to install extra libraries libdots and qml-plugin.
